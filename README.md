# optKnock
Coupling of growth and production in a strain is achieved by selective mutation suggested by the OptKnock algorithm, where the production of a particular metabolite becomes obligatory byproduct of organism growth. OptKnock not only identifies straight forward strategies but also finds nonintuitive strategies of reaction deletion. OptKnock forms two layered optimization problem and hence it is bilevel optimization algorithm.
Here we have used Yeast 7.5 consensus model         <http://sourceforge.net/projects/yeast/files/>
